This project features a modern fighter jet modeled in SolidWorks, inspired by the Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. It emphasizes aerodynamic form, surface continuity, and structural realism, achieved through advanced lofting, guide curves, and surface knitting techniques. The design includes side wing missiles, a streamlined canopy, and a smooth, balanced fuselage.
