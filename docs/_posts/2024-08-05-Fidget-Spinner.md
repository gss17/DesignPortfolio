Designed a custom fidget spinner capable of holding pennies in the hole slots for balance and weight distribution. Conducted finite element analysis (FEA) to ensure structural integrity and stress resistance under load. Prototyped using laser cutting and 3D printing, refining for smooth motion and durability.
