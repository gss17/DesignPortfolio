I completed a composite layup as part of a group project during a Texas Design, Build, and Fly structures team workday. The process began with 3D printing a cavity mold of our design, followed by sanding it to achieve smooth surfaces and clean edges. We then applied several layers of mold release wax before preparing a 50/50 resin mixture, which was used to saturate fiberglass laid inside the mold. Once the layup was complete, we enclosed the mold and vacuum sealed it to ensure proper compression and allow the composite to dry evenly.
